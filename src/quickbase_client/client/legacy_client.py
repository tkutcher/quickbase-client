    """Legacy Client which makes requests to the old XML API.

    This operates more generically to send any request to the old API. It's primary
    purpose is to supplement the JSON API for things not yet supported.

    It does include some higher-level methods for things that in particular are
    not supported in the new API's. If there are others you would like added,
    submit an Issue or a Merge-Request and we can certainly add it!

    Rather than get in to having lxml as an optional dependency, it will just deal
    with XML data as strings for now. If we want more support of the XML API, then
    it might be worth it to introduce that.
